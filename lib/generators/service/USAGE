Description:
    Stubs out a new service. Pass the service name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of its methods as
    arguments.

    To create a service within a module, just add --module NAME, or --module=NAME

    This generates a service class in app/services, or app/services/module
    if module name is present.

    This also generates a spec class in spec/services or spec/services/module,
    or test class in test/services or test/services/module.

Example:
    `rails generate service MailerService send receive --module MailerModule`

    This will create:
        app/services/mailer_module/mailer_service.rb
        spec/services/mailer_module/mailer_service_spec.rb
        OR
        test/services/mailer_module/mailer_service_test.rb
